# PHP-FPM 7.0

# Setup

There is a script called `build.sample.sh` that can be copied to `build.sh`. When `build.sh` exists this script will be executed
when the container for that PHP version is built.

Note: Properly configuring PHP containers is outside the scope of this document. Please see https://hub.docker.com/_/php for how to
properly configure a PHP Docker container.
