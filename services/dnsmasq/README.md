# DNSMasq

This container will let you run a DNS server using DNSMasq. This container was built off the generic Alpine container.

## Setup

You must create a `dnsmasq.conf` file to configure DNSMasq. We have provided the default configuration file `dnsmasq.sample.conf`
for your convenience. Proper configuration of DNSMasq is outside the scope of this documentation.
